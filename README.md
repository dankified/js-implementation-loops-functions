# Functions and loops implementation

## Introduction
We will be building several functions throughout this lecture. In order to do this we will be employing a test driven development approach. We won't be talking about test driven development for now, but picture it as your own private Quality Assurance technician that is testing your code as you write it. As I said before, we will not focus on test driven development here, but in order to take advantage of it we need to do some initial setup first.

## setup
1. Change directory ```(cd)``` into your ```wyncode``` folder
2. Create a new directory named ```js-loops-functions```
implementation lectures for us to use.
3. Change directory into the newly created folder
4. Type in your terminal ```npm i -g jest```. This command will install the jest testing library. This is what makes the testing magic happen.
5. Once that's done type ```npm run test```. You will most likely see a couple of errors, and that's totally fine considering that we have not written any code.
6. As soon as you start writing your functions you'll start seeing how some of the tests start passing.

## Instructions.
All your coding will be done in the files located inside the ```exercises``` directory
1. In sum.js declare a function named ```sum``` with two ```parameters```. This function should return the sum of both ```arguments``` when called. e.g: ```sum(2,2)``` will return ```4```.
2. In squareRoot.js declare a function named ```squareRoot``` with one ```parameter```. This function should return the square root of whatever ```argument``` you pass to it. e.g: ```squareRoot(4)``` should return ```2```
3. In isEven.js declare a function named ```isEven``` with one ```parameter```. This function will return ```true``` if the ```argument``` is even, and ```false``` if the ```argument``` is odd. e.g: ```isEven(2)``` returns ```true```. ```isEven(3)``` returns ```false```
4. In isThereFalseInArray.js declare a function named ```isThereFalseInArray``` with one ```parameter```. This function will return ```true``` if one of the elements in the ```argument``` is falsey, and it will return ```false``` if no element in the ```argument``` is falsey. e.g: ``isThereFalseInArray([1,2,3,false,5])`` will return ```true```.
5. In animalSound.js declare a function named ```animalSound``` with one parameter. The function will return an animal sound based on the ```argument``` that's passed to it.
```animalSound("moo")``` returns ```"cow"```
```animalSound("meow")``` return ```"cat"```
```animalSound("woof")``` returns ```"dog"```
```animalSound("caw caw")``` returns ```"crow"```
This function will return ```"Don't know that sound"```  for every other string.
Hint: You shouldn't use ```if else``` statements for this one.
